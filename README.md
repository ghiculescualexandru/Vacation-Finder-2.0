## Vacation-Finder-2.0 ##

This is a Python application where you are either an user or the administrator.

As user you can search for a sport or you can look up available sports in specific locations or countries, ordering the results by price.
As the administrator, besides what an user can do, you can add new locations, regions, countriez, zones and sports.

For the **graphic user interface** *tkinter* was used. 

It was made to be used both with a GUI and in the terminal, so in the source codes there are comments for each function (FOR TERMINAL/FOR GUI).
The database file is just a text with some 'add' commands so that the program already has some data to work with (especially for the user).
